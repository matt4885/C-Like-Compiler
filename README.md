# C-Minus-Compiler
C-Minus-Compiler is an implementation of the C- language (a typical language used for teaching
compilers/language construction) in the C language. It is a learning experience for the C language, most 
importantly covering the topics of modularity, data structures (linked lists, etc.) and version control. The 
program may not work 100%, but the eventual
goal is to get it to work mostly.

Parts of the compiler that are done:


* Lexical Analyzer  (70%)
* Parser            (0%)
* Semantic Analyzer (0%)
* Code Generator    (0%)
